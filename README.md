# Elixir

Elixir is a playground for me to put my ideas into code. The code in this repository
is not meant for production, but for experimentation and discussion. I use this
library for testing out my ideas, understanding concepts and and implementing some
latest C++ features and proposals to get a better understanding of them.

## Sub-topics

Following are some of the topics that I have prototyped in this repository

1. **Loops**: This library is an implementation of my idea of re-imagining C++ for loops
   using index instead of iterators. This is probably not a new idea, but I have been
   playing around with this for a while in my head and I wanted to see how this would work.
   I do not claim that this is a better approach, but I have really liked using this approach
   so far. For more detail, see [here](/doc/Loops/Readme.md)
